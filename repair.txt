Hi,

In July 2024 I received the enclosed braces appliance.  I am very pleased with both the quality of this appliance, and your excellent customer service.  Unfortunately, the arch wire on the lower appliance has broken, so I would like it repaired.

I have been very careful handling this appliance...  When I insert it, remove it, clean it, and store it, I always handle the appliance gently and carefully.

Although the quality of the enclosed braces appliance is excellent, I fear that just normal wear, and gentle handling of the appliance, may soon again lead to another breakage.  The problem is that the arch wires (upper and lower) are quite narrow, and therefore they are not very strong.  Even with gentle handling, the arch wires can bend quite easily.  And repeated gentle bending of the arch wire may cause another breakage, I fear.

I had this appliance only 6 months and it broke.  To prevent another breakage, I will be even more careful handling the appliance after it gets repaired.  But I am wondering if this is possible?...

Could you do something to both the lower and upper arch wires to re-enforce them, make them stronger, make them herder to bend?  I am thinking of adding more soldering (or more welding) to the area where the arch wires attach to the molar crowns.  Even a large blob of solder would be OK.  I only care that the appliance still fits.

In addition to adding more soldering/welding, I think you could maybe do one, or both, of the following...

1) Add a re-enforcing wire from the molar crowns to one of the elastic hooks on the arch wire.

2) Add a re-enforcing wire from the large elastic hooks (which are currently welded to the molar
   crowns on both arch wires) to one of the elastic hooks on the arch wire.

These re-enforcing wires would be added to the left side, and right side, of the arch wire.  On both the top appliance and the bottom appliance.

Please consider performing any fix (on both upper and lower arch wires) that will make the arch wires stronger, less likely to bend and break.  If performing additional arch wire re-enforcement will cost extra, please let me know how much it will cost.  I will then pay via PayPal.

Finally, I have enclosed one piston rod, and one hollow tube, from my Herbst Appliance that I would like trimmed.  A piece of tape on each of those items specifies how much they should be trimmed.

Thanks,
